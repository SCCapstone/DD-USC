To test DD-USC you have two options: 
	1. If you have a Mac but no iOS device you may download the source code and open up the project in Xcode and run the emulator. 
	2. If you have an iOS device then you can email coleca@email.sc.edu your apple id (the email address that you signed up with the iTunes store) and we will send you an email with an invitation to sign up with iTunes Connect (free, you just use your apple id and login). After you are signed up with iTunes Connect then you will receive a second email with instructions on how to install and use TestFlight (a free iOS demoing app).

**If you have any question please contact us by Github issues.
